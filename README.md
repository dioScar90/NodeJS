### My Progress with Node.js

This is an repository I created to save all my progress with **Node.js**. I started to learn this tool through a minicourse at my college with teacher Daniel from the channel **Dev2Dev**, later I complemented this experience with teacher Felipe Rocha from the channel **dicasparadevs**, and then I carried on searching for more and more information about it.
